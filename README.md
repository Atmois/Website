# Website

My website :D 
Go see it at [atmois.com](https://atmois.com)

I took the idea for the design from [Sapphic Angel's Website](https://sapphic.moe) so absoloute credit for their design goes to them, I just took their design and built my site on it however none of the code I have made was taken from their site, I just tried to replicate the style.
